In this series, we will be discussing the various steps involved in a data science project. This is the first part of the series where we will be discussing how to get the data for our project.

## Introduction

Data is the most important part of any data science project. Without data, we cannot perform any analysis or build any models. There are various ways to get the data for our project. Some of the most common ways are:

1. **Web Scraping**: This is the process of extracting data from websites. We can use libraries like `requests` and `beautifulsoup` in Python to scrape data from websites.
2. **APIs**: Many websites provide APIs to access their data. We can use these APIs to get the data we need.
3. **Databases**: We can also get data from databases. There are many public databases available on the internet that we can use for our projects.

In this part, we will be discussing how to get the data using web scraping.
